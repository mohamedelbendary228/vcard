About me

I’m interested in mobile application development. Now I write dart
and use flutter framework to build large scale projects from scratch
using the best practices, I manipulated and implemented object-oriented
programming models. Planned and developed interfaces that simplified overall
management and offered ease of use. I’m always adding
new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software
engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!

I am so grateful to work with Mohamed, in whom I found all the enthusiasm I could not find in anyone else, and his ability to learn and adapt quickly and effectively.
I was also drawn to his ability to adequately analyze the problems he encounters, then think of the most appropriate ways to solve that problem, present his solutions to his colleagues, and ultimately choose the best solution.
Mohamed is an intelligent person, thinks about problems logically, and is very good at learning new things and concepts quickly.
